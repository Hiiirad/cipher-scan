# cipher-scan
A Bash script to test and identify supported SSL/TLS ciphers for a specified domain and port. This script iterates through all available ciphers, using openssl, and logs whether each cipher is accepted or rejected by the target server. It's a useful tool for security analysis and verifying the strength of a server's encryption.
